# AIRBNB-HOST-BENEFICIARY-SYSTEM
A lot of research and analysis has been conducted for the guests but not much information is  available  for  the  hosts to  make  decisions that  would  help  them increase  their  profits. Severalfactors are at play that determine the profitability of a particular property such as the number of beds,  the  location,  the  proximity  to  transportation  services  and  tourist  spots  etc.  Through  this project, we aim to helpan investor identify places in different locations that will get the highest ratings and generate profit by using success rate as a parameter. Success rate will be calculated on the basis of revenue, investment, ratings and location. The model shall help one predict the right pricing of a listing with respect to the location, services offered, guest capacity, space rented out and listing prices at similar locations. Setting the right price is prudent as it helps in increasing the number of bookings and occupancy of the space. Airbnb, over time, has become very competitive and it is important for owners to be aware of the correct market rate to minimize the chances of loss.
